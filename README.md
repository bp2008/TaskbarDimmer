# TaskbarDimmer
A windows tray application that dims the taskbar on all your monitors.

The dimming is removed temporarily when you mouse over a taskbar or when the active window is full-screened.

Currently very little is configurable.  The program assumes you have a taskbar in the bottom 30px of all connected screens.
